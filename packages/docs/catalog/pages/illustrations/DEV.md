Contactlab Marketing Cloud's illustrations can both enhance the user experience and express a brandâ€™s visual language. Illustrations help tell a story and clarify complex messages that are difficult to express with words.

# Installation

For most projects (and to take advantage of Design System's customization features), you'll want to install Contactlab Design Token via npm.

```code
lang: sh
---
# Using npm
npm install @contactlab/milky-way

# Using Yarn
yarn add @contactlab/milky-way
```

---

# Getting Started

You can use our illustrations and retrieve them as you like from the **node_modules** folder. A minified version is also available.
