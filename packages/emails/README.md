The Contactlab Marketing Cloud transactional emails.

## [Preview][netlify-url]

#### Run dev environment

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and point to http://localhost:3333/.
The http server will listen and restart upon each change inside `src` folder.
You just need to refresh a browser window manually.

#### Generate htmls

You can also run and get your email in html format inside a `dist` folder:

```sh
npm run generate
```

#### Thanks
