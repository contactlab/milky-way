## Run dev environment

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and point to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
The http server will listen and restart upon each change inside `src` folder.
You just need to refresh a browser window manually.

## Generate htmls

You can also run and get your email in html format inside a `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run generate
```
