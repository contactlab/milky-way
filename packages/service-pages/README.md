# Service Pages

The Contactlab Marketing Cloud service pages.

## [Preview][netlify-url]

#### Create a new template

Creating a new service page is easy-peasy: go to the [views](./src/views) folder and edit the [current.pug](./src/views/current.pug) file _(it is better if you copy and rename the existing one)_. Afterwards, you can start the dev-server or start a build process.

#### Commands

```sh
# Run linters
$ npm run lint

# Start dev-server
$ npm run dev

# Build for production
$ npm run build

# Serve static files
$ npm run serve
```
