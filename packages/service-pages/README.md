# Service Pages

The Contactlab Marketing Cloud service pages.

## [Preview][netlify-url]

### Create a new template

Creating a new service page is easy-peasy: go to the [src](./src) folder and create a new pug file in the root _(it is better if you copy and rename the existing one)_. Afterwards, you can start the dev-server or start a build process.

### Commands

```sh
# Start dev-server
$ npm run dev

# Build for production
$ npm run build

# Run linters
$ npm run lint
```
