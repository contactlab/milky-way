# Rush uses this file to configure the NPM package registry during installation.
# It is applicable to PNPM, NPM, and Yarn package managers.
# It is used by operations such as "rush install", "rush update", and the "install-run.js" scripts.
#
# NOTE: The "rush publish" command uses .npmrc-publish instead.
#
# Before invoking the package manager, Rush will copy this file to the folder where installation
# is performed. The copied file will omit any config lines that reference environment variables
# that are undefined in that session; this avoids problems that would otherwise result due to
# a missing variable being replaced by an empty string.
